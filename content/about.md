I earned a Ph.D. in AI Planning and Robotics from [IEETA](https://www.ieeta.pt/) at the [University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt/), Portugal. My doctoral dissertation contributes to the development of novel algorithms for knowledge representation, robot learning, and task planning. Prior to this, I earned my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer engineering from [Qazvin Azad University](https://qazvin.iau.ir/en) in Iran.

Following the completion of my Ph.D., I conducted postdoctoral research in the [Robotics Research Group](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/research/robotics) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) from December 2018 to August 2022. During this period, my research interests centered around artificial intelligence, automated planning, robotics, and robot learning. Specifically, I focused on integrating AI planning into real robotic systems to bridge the gap between AI and robotics. This endeavor resulted in the development of cutting-edge techniques and open-source tools for robot programming and planning.

Currently, I serve as a software engineer at [OMP](https://omp.com/), specializing in the development of software solutions for supply chain planning and optimization.
