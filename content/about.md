I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees in computer engineering from [Qazvin Azad University](https://qazvin.iau.ir/en) in Iran. Later, I completed my Ph.D. in AI Planning and Robotics at the [Institute of Electronics and Informatics Engineering of Aveiro (IEETA)](https://www.ieeta.pt/) at the [University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt/), Portugal. My doctoral dissertation contributes to developing novel algorithms for knowledge representation, robot learning, and task planning.

Following my Ph.D., I conducted postdoctoral research in the [Robotics Research Group](https://www.mech.kuleuven.be/en/pma/research/robotics) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) from December 2018 to August 2022. My postdoctoral research interests lie in artificial intelligence, automated planning, robotics, and robot learning. Specifically, my research focused on bridging the gap between AI and robotics through the integration of AI planning into real robotic systems. This effort resulted in the development of state-of-the-art techniques and open-source tools for robot programming and planning.

I am currently a software engineer at [OMP](https://omp.com/), where I specialize in developing software solutions for supply chain planning and optimization.
